            <h3>History</h3>
        <p>The mission started as a reformulation of the Jupiter 			
        	Ganymede Orbiter proposal, which was to be ESA's 	
        	component of the former Europa Jupiter System 	
            Mission - Laplace (EJSM-Laplace).[3] It is a 
            candidate to become the first L-class mission (L1) 
            of the ESA Cosmic Vision Programme. In April 2012 
            JUICE was recommended over the proposed ATHENA X-ray 				
            telescope and a gravitational wave observatory (New 
            Gravitational wave Observatory (NGO))</p>
        <h3>Science Objectives</h3>
      	<p>The Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE) would perform 		
            detailed investigations on Ganymede as a planetary body 
            and evaluate its potential to support life. 
            Investigations of Europa and Callisto would complete a 
            comparative picture of these Galilean moons.[6] The 
            three moons are believed to harbour internal liquid 
            water oceans, and so are central to understanding the 
            habitability of icy worlds.
            The main science objectives for Ganymede, and to a 		
            lesser extent for Callisto, are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Characterisation of the ocean layers and detection of 	
  		putative subsurface water reservoirs;</li>
 <li>Topographical, geological and compositional mapping of the 
		surface;</li>
  <li>Study of the physical properties of the icy crusts;
    	Characterisation of the internal mass distribution, 	
        dynamics and evolution of the interiors;</li>
   
  <li>Investigation of the exosphere;</li>
  <li>Study of Ganymede's intrinsic magnetic field and its 	
  		interactions with the Jovian magnetosphere.</li>
</ul>
<p>For Europa, the focus is on the chemistry essential to life, 	
	including organic molecules, and on understanding the 
    formation of surface features and the composition of the non
    water-ice material. Furthermore, JUICE will provide the 
    first subsurface sounding of the moon, including the first 
    determination of the minimal thickness of the icy crust over
    the most recently active regions.</p>
